# Design
# 1) What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

I think the most helpful when thinking about design methods of the project is knowing what exactly is the scope of the project, who are the users, and
the process of defining the problem and needs, coming up with ideas, prototyping, and testing. This isn't necessarily a step by step process and can happen reapetedly or in parallel but it ultimately decided the design methods that we used. 

# 2) What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I think the most difficult thing about the design process is just clarifying and translating the project requirements into a project. I feel like when I have so much freedom with a project, it's very easy to go overboard with translating what's actually needed for the project. Then when designing the actual project, it was hard to avoid bad code practices like god classes or functions that just simply do too much which goes against the idea of low coupling and high cohesion and that's something that  I want to practice moving forward. I also want to practice using UML diagrams from the very beginning because it truly gives a better sense of what we're making exactly. Even though it did feel a little redundant doing it this semester, it created a more organized class structure and functions. 

# 3) What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
I think I'd like to practice function oriented design and objected oriented design in future projects. But it truly depends on just the scope and context of the project that I would be working on. 

 

# Implementation
# 1) What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

I think the mosth elpful thing about implementing, testing, and integration in our bot project was using git, github, and code cleaner tools like ESlint. Working as a team on a project could get very messy real fast if there's no proper version control tool. My team had a good knowledge of github so we implemented things like having branches so we were not all working under the main version of the project and had to make a pull request before even implementing it into main. Because we implemented a code cleaner into our project, everytime we pushed up to the remote origin on github, it would format our  code to have clean code practices before it even got pushed. 


# What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult practice for me was commiting code and failing often. Often times, I wouldn't want to commit any code because I feel like it wouldn't be enough. But the whole point of doign these practices is to try, fail and redo again. It was also hard to manually keep these good coding practices in mind when I was writing the code myself because I was depending on the code cleaner to just catch my mistakes for me. However, I would want to implement good code practices moving forward. 

# What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would practice everything I did in this project such as used of branches, PRs, and clean code tools. 

# Process
# What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

The implementation of kanban and code review was probably my favorite part of the entire project. My team would set up a zoom meeting to create issues, we would assign points to them, and then assign the actual issues to a team member. That's not something I really practiced with other group projects but it is incredibly useful and was a lot of fun just working it out with my team. We used a website called pointing poker which allowed each member to hide how much points they assigned to a specific task so there was no bias and then revealed everyone's assignment once they were finished and then we got to discuss and readjust collectively what we think the points are for th specific task. I didn't realize the true effect of code review until  I started doing it with my group this semester. I got to learn so much by my group members pointing out what they found flawed in my code once I pushed it up and it was an incredible learning experience. 

# What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I guess the most difficult was keeping up with pull request's and reading other member's codes once they pushed it up. Usually one person gets to review the code and approve to merge it and I wouldn't really have the time to look through it. Moving forward, I'd like to be play the reviewer role a lot more and give feedback to my team members. 

# What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I'd like to implement the use of Kanban and code reviews again but maybe using different tools like Trello or Jira. 

# Overall
Overall, I think the methods that we used for this project were the perfect combination to create a bot we were truly proud about. Having a member who has been working in the industry doing software development has been incredibly helpful because he shared his experience with these designs, tools, and processes. I think it's just important to be conscious of implementing good code design like modelling and avoiding smelly code.
